# JobEngine
Welcome to the JobEngine repo.  JobEngine allows you to execute automation jobs over a distributed network of clients installed as windows services.  Clients can be connected via the inter-webs or over the LAN.  Jobs can be executed in realtime or by using complex cron schedules.  The current version has the ability to execute assembly jobs (*.dll) with plans of adding more job types such as MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, PowerShell etc..

The goal is to create a centralized management console for scheduling and distributing automation jobs with the ability to execute them on-demand in realtime.  There's still plenty of work left to do.

*UNDER DEVELOPMENT*
